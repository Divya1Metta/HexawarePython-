> Balance Factor = height(left subtree) - height(right subtree)
 
```python
# Variable declaration
 x = 10 + 8
```
 
```js
// This is a comment
const x = 10 + 8;
```
 
## Shortcuts ⌨️
 
Below are some useful shortcuts in vscode
 
- `alt + (up/down)` - Move line (up/down)
- `ctrl + /` - Comment code
- `ctrl + shift + p` - Vscode Command palette
- `win + .` - Emoji panel
 
### Selection Sort
 
Always select the smallest one and move it to front

| Unbalance Type | Solution        |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| LL             | Clock-wise      |
| RR             | Anti-clock Wise |
| LR             | LL              |
| RL             | RR              |
 

**why design before coding ?**
- Virtual representation for client
- Guide for you to code
- Figuring out the right way to implement
- Looking at the bigger picture and outlining


## Problem Solving

- Define the problem
- Analyze
- esigning I.e figma
- focusing on diff outcomes ,iterative approach
- deciding
- implement or coding
- testing 
- follow up or deployment


## Skills of software developer

- Analytical skills
- Analysis
- Design
- Tech knowledge
- Programming ability
- Testing
- Quality planning and practice I.e feedback
- Innovative all time
- Team working
- Communication domain expert
- Avoids over engineering



## Performance measure

- deadlines or timelines
- Quality of work I.e being specific over generalised
- Customer orientation
- Optimal solution
- Team satisfaction.   Make it work->make it better
- Mail every month add ons u did apart from job

Types of problems
- **concurrent**  :
  ex: cooking coffee, egg, toast     1cook-thread, >cook-multithread
- **sequential** : ex: order wise
- **distribution** : ex:task is divided into multiple tasks and worked on distributed network which work as single system
- **Event based.** : Ex: event listener ,event queue ,event loop, event handler



## Problem solving methods


1. bruteforcing;    Simple,time consuming, not optimal, basic approach
2.  Greedy ;      used in minimisation or maximisation, optimisation problems
3. Heuristic approach
4. Dynamic programming ; i.e.,overlapping solution ,recursive, storing in table or cache
5. Divide and conquer ; i.e.,sub problems

## Modeling tools

1. flowcharts. ex: C
2. Data flow diagrams.  ex:Cloud
3. entity relationship.  ex:Db
4. Uml ex:python

> Data structures focuses on representation and manipulation

> Algorithm is defined as unambiguous instructions to solve a problem  within finite amount of time

-  Array continuous in main memory  static
- Linked list non continuous heap.     Dynamic


## Alg properties

- I/p,o/p,workable,optimum,lang.independent { pseudo code}, fitness
- Looping use goto steps
- Selections using set

## Sorting techniques
1. Quick
2. Merge
3. Heap
4. Selection
5. Insertion

## Searching Techniques

1. Linear
2. Binary
